4,"The supply and use tables are built around three classification systems, namely the Input-Output Industry Classification (IOIC) for industries, the Supply and Use Product Classification (SUPC) for products (goods and services), and the Input-Output Final Demand Classification (IOFDC) for final demand categories. The Input-Output Industry Classification (IOIC) is based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and the Supply and Use Product Classification (SUPC) is based on the North American Products Classification System (NAPCS). The Input-Output Final Demand Classification is based on the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) for the personal expenditure categories and the North American Industry Classification (NAICS) for the gross fixed capital formation categories.  This table is published at the link 1961 level of the supply and use tables.",,,,,,,,,,
5,"The alphanumeric codes appearing in square brackets beside each industry title represent the Input-Output Industry Classification (IOIC) codes. The IOIC identifies both institutional sectors and industries based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The first two characters of the IOIC alphanumeric codes represent the sector. IOIC codes beginning with a BS represent business sector industries, codes beginning with an NP represent Non-Profit Institutions Serving Household (NPISH) sector industries, and codes beginning with a GS represent government sector industries.",,,,,,,,,,

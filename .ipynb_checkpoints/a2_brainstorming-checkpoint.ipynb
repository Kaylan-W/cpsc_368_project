    "Using various datasets, we will investigate the correlation between fuel consumption and greenhouse emissions for various industries within Canada. We will investigate the relationship between the two and how they have changed between 2000 and 2022, and use employment data for these industries to calculate a per capita consumption to emission ratio. This per capita calculation will allows us to compare different industries on the same scale, so that we can identify trends in the main industrial contributors to greenhouse gas emissions over a 22 year period.       \n",

This is directly related to both climate and sustainability. Green house gas emissions are known contributors to damage to the ozone layer and changes in global climate patterns. Fuel consumption is related to sustainability because most sources of fuel are non-renewable, and thus ought to be utilized carefully. These concerns are also related to global initiatives at reducing national carbon footprints.   \n",

    "    - Another approach would be to not include the per capita numbers for industries. Instead, we would analyze the trends in individual industries as a whole over 22 years. However, this would prevent us from accurately comparing different sized industries. Having a base unit that is the same across all industries is necessary for an accurate analysis of each industry's effects. \n",

Our datasets also meet the assumptions required to use linear regression, such as variables being normally distributed. Ensuring these assumptions are met maintains the integrity of our findings. We are also using large sample sizes, which can ensure the ability to generalize findings to all of Canada. In general the model will likely be uncomplicated, and easy to replicate.\n",

The amount of water flowing through a stream, river, or creek at a given time is referred to as discharge measured in m^3/s. The discharge of a river is a function of velocity of flow, stage, and width of a river and is a useful predictor in determining the risk of imminent flash flooding.\n",

We will use employment data for these industries to calculate a per capita consumption to emission ratio that quantifies the effect of growth per industry on the environment.

    "- We are analyzing potential patterns based on climate data to see if any affect average temperatures in the year. Through this, we can also look at potential causes for changes in the trend of the temperature around BC/the lower mainland. This plan may require modelling, either linear or some other method, to achieve this.\n",

    "- This is the best method because we are wanting to make inference on the data, and perhaps use this to predict future average temperatures given trends of other data. Instead of fitting a model on just temperature data alone, we can use air quality, wind, pressure, and many others to help with the analysis. \n",

We will need to check over the course of our project, but our current assumption is that we can apply parametric regression and models for this. KNN and Decision Trees are also much harder to interpret the methods we are thinking of using.\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "**Identify the statistical rigour of the methodology you are choosing.** \n",
    "- The chosen method may have some doubts, specifically how we are using the data. For example, we will need to be careful about treating our explanatory variables as predictors, as these data may actually be better responses over predictors. We also need to be careful about making sure that our variables may be changing due to other factors as well. We are making lots of assumptions, making the world much simpler than it already is. However, we are confident that we will be able to remedy these issues within this project."
